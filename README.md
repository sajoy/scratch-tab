# scratch pad
not a scratching post<br>
not a fancy app<br>
definitely a chrome extension<br>
definitely a place to remind yourself to PAY RENT TODAY OR ELSE<br>
maybe a place to remind yourself YOU'RE AWESOME/OKAY/BEAUTIFUL.<br>
just some virtual scratch paper in your new tab

# roadmap
in no particular order; FYI we're taking the scenic (aka slow) route.

- make note name and order editable
- offer preset color themes
- allow custom colors
- animate notes appearing/disappearing
- add keyboard shortcut to create new note
- delete from note?
- toggle between vertical & horizontal scrolling
- allow custom tab title
- add hide/show all buttons

# known bugs
- list of notes probably will not scroll

# contributing

If you want to, have at it! Here's what you need to know:
- written in Vanilla JS ( a weird mix of ES5 & ES6 ...)
- fork, clone into your local machine, to run as a local chrome extension see [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
