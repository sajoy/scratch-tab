# scratch pad
not a scratching post<br>
not a fancy app<br>
definitely a chrome extension<br>
definitely a place to remind yourself to PAY RENT TODAY OR ELSE<br>
maybe a place to remind yourself YOU'RE AWESOME/OKAY/BEAUTIFUL.<br>
just some virtual scratch paper in your new tab

# roadmap

**maybe later**
1. add keyboard shortcut to create new note
1. allow user to add custom keyboard shortcuts to toggle specific notes
1. create note types: agenda, list, dictionary list, image

1. delete from note's edit menu?
1. allow toggle between vertical & horizontal scrolling
1. allow cancel when adding new note
