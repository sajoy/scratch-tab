---- User Stories / Road Map (Ambitious Level) ----
1. As a user I want to toggle showing the agenda, goals, scratch pad, styles, and image sections
2. As a user I want to provide a link for an image to show
3. As a user I want to be able to pick a background color and font color
4. As a user I want to be able to pick a bullet style
5. As a user I want a keyboard shortcut for toggling the sections (ALT + A,G,S,V) https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/commands (but does it always happen even without a new tab open?)
6. As a user I want to see a random motivational mantra as the title

---- List class ----
list.init()
 - populate any data saved for list
list.saveData( key, value )
 - called on blur of contenteditable items?
 - save updated text for lists in localstorage
 - also use to save styles
list.deleteData( key )
 - remove data from localstorage

--------------------- or are Image, Scratchpad, Goals just instances of List with a special name/keypath?
---- Image class ----
image.init()
 - inherit List

---- Scratchpad class ----
scratchpad.init()
 - inherit List

---- Goals class ----
goals.init()
 - inherit List

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---- Agenda class ----
agenda.init()
 - inherit from List
 - list out a two week agenda starting from 7 days ago
 - populate any data saved for specific dates
agenda.moveForward()
 - show the next date at the bottom of the agenda
 - or does this happen on every page load?
 - can this happen at midnight? (of their timezone)
 - List.deleteData()

---- Agenda User Stories  ----
1. as a user I want to see the next 7 days on my agenda
2. as a user I want to be able to scroll up to see the previous 7 days on my agenda // are you sure? might need a data base then.. (or just don't persist after)
3. as a user I want to edit the text next to the agenda's date
4. as a user I want to not edit the text in last week's agenda

a user's first note

note: scratch pad

_WHAT IS THIS_
Kinda like a scratching post for your sharp wit.
Or just, you know, virtual scratch paper.
I'll follow you around in every single new tab you open.


_HOW TO DO STUFF_
Create [+] and delete [x] new notes from the menu in the bottom left.
Click a note's name in the menu to show or hide it.
To edit a note's name or placement:
    hover over it's name (^up there, not in the menu) then click [edit].
Click [s] to edit the theme colors, tab title and default note content.


_FYI_
All your musings, kill lists, etc are saved locally to your browser.
I promise I'm not stalking you IRL.
