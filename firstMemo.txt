_WHAT IS THIS_
I'm kinda like a scratching post for your sharp wit.
Or just, you know, virtual scratch paper.
I'll follow you around in every single new tab you open.


_HOW TO DO STUFF_
Create [+] and delete [x] new notes from the menu in the bottom left.
Click a note's name in the menu to show or hide it.


_FYI_
All your musings, kill lists, etc are saved locally to your browser.
I promise I'm not stalking you IRL.
