# Version 2.0 ?

## MVP
- split screen scratch pad with 2? pads per panel
- split screen vertically about 2/3 : 1/3
- right panel = agenda or scratchpad
- left side = scratchpad or image
- toggle with switch on either side
- style panel from the bottom
  - or in the opposite panel
  - maybe style width of panels
- agenda class
  - move any item with a + to the next day
  - load with today at the top and at full opacity
  - every other day is .7 opacity
  - show 15 days with today as day 8

## maybes
- allow resizing of panels
- make new pads but only ever show two
- only make up to 10 new pads on right side, no adding/removing from left
- is the right side a column of pads?!!!
- auto delete? (after certain amount of time?)

using moment in extension?

## musings
- what is the problem(s) this solves?
  - the need for virtual scratch paper- somewhere to paste or type and then later move to where it needs to be
  - reminding you of long and short term goals with every new tab (or whatever you want to be reminded of)
